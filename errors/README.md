### Error handling
The scala standard library provides 3 types that can be used for error handling: Option, Either, and Try.

Each subdirectory here contains:

1. a cheatsheet explaining how to use the type (e.g. `option.sc`).
2. an exercise, `payment.sc`. Run using `amm payment.sc` to see if the assertions pass.
3. a completed version of the exercise, `payment-done.sc`.
